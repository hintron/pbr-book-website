</p>
<p>Achieving good performance on GPUs requires some care in how computation is
organized and how data is laid out in memory.  We will start with an
overview of how GPUs work and the ways in which they differ from CPUs.  This foundation
makes it possible to discuss the design space of GPU ray tracers.  After
summarizing some of the alternatives, we give an overview of the design of
the wavefront path integrator, which subsequent sections will delve into
more deeply.

</p>
<p>The performance difference between CPUs and GPUs stems from a fundamental
difference in the computations that they are designed for.  CPUs have long
been designed to minimize <em>latency</em>&mdash;to run a single thread of
computation as efficiently as possible, finishing its work as quickly as
possible.  (This has somewhat changed with the advent of multicore CPUs,
though each core remains latency optimized.)
In contrast, GPUs target <em>throughput</em>: they are designed to work on
many computations in parallel and finish all of them quickly, which is a
different thing than finishing any one of them as quickly as possible.

</p>
<p>The focus on throughput allows GPUs to devote much less space on the chip
for caches, branch prediction hardware, out-of-order execution units, and
other features that have been invented to improve single-thread performance
on CPUs.  Thus, given a fixed amount of chip area, GPUs are able to provide
many more of the arithmetic logic units (ALUs) that actually perform
computation than a CPU provides.  Yet, more ALUs do not necessarily deliver more
performance: they must be kept occupied doing useful work.  

</p>
<p>An ALU cannot perform computation if the input values it requires are not
available.  On current processors, reading a value from memory consumes a
few hundred processor cycles, and so it is important to avoid the situation
where a processor remains idle while it waits for the completion of such read
operations&mdash;substantial amounts of potential computation might be
lost. CPUs and GPUs approach this problem quite differently.  Understanding
each helps illuminate their philosophical differences.

</p>
<p>CPUs apply a barrage of techniques to this task.  They feature a relatively
large amount of on-chip memory in the form of caches; if a memory request
targets a location that is already present in a cache, the result can be returned
much more quickly than reading from dynamic random access
memory (DRAM).  Cache memory access typically
takes from a handful of cycles to at most a few tens of them.
When it is necessary to wait for a memory
read, CPUs also use out-of-order execution, continuing to execute the program&rsquo;s
instructions past the read instruction. Dependencies are carefully tracked
during this process, and operations that are independent of pending
computations can execute out of order. The CPU
may also execute instructions speculatively, ready to roll back their
effects if it turns out they should not have run.  If all of that does not
suffice, another thread may be available, ready to start executing&mdash;modern
CPUs generally use <em>hyperthreading</em> to switch to another thread in the
event of a stall.  This thread switch can be performed without any
overhead, which is much better than the thousands of processor cycles it
takes for the operating system to perform a context switch.

</p>
<p>GPUs instead focus on a single mechanism to address such latencies: much
more aggressive thread switching, over many more threads than are used for
hyperthreading on CPUs.  If one thread reads from memory, a GPU will just
switch to another, saving all of the complexity and chip area required for
out-of-order execution logic.  If that other thread issues a read, then yet
another is scheduled.  Given enough threads and computation between memory
accesses, such an approach is sufficient to keep the ALUs fed with useful
work while avoiding long periods of inactivity.

</p>
<p>An implication of this design is that GPUs require much more parallelism
than CPUs to run at their peak potential.  While tens of threads&mdash;or at most a few
hundred&mdash;suffice to fully utilize a modern multicore CPU, a GPU may
require tens of thousands of them. Path tracing
fortunately involves millions of independent calculations (one per pixel
sample), which makes it a good fit for throughput-oriented
architectures like GPUs.

<span id="x1-ThreadExecution"></span><h4>Thread Execution</h4><p>


</p>
<p>GPUs contain an array of independent processors, numbered from the tens up
to nearly a hundred at writing.  We will not often need to consider these
in the following, but will denote them as <em>processors</em> when we
do.<button style="button" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="right" data-html="true" class="btn footnote-button" title="These correspond to <em>compute units</em> on AMD GPUs,
<em>execution units</em> on Intel GPUs, and <em>streaming multiprocessors</em>
on NVIDIA GPUs.">
      <sup>&dagger;</sup>
    </button>
		  Each one typically executes 32 or 64 threads
concurrently, with as many as a thousand threads available to be scheduled.

</p>
<p>The execution model of GPUs centers around the concept of a <em>kernel</em>,
which refers to a GPU-targeted function that is executed by a specified number
of threads. Parameters passed to the kernel are forwarded to each thread; a
<em>thread index</em> provides the information needed to distinguish one thread from
another. <em>Launching</em> a kernel refers to the operation that informs the GPU
that a particular kernel function should be executed concurrently. This differs
from an ordinary function call in the sense that the kernel will complete
asynchronously at some later point. Frameworks like CUDA provide extensive API
functionality to wait for the conclusion of such asynchronous computation, or
to enforce ordering constraints between multiple separate kernel launches.
Launching vast numbers of threads on the GPU is extremely efficient, so there
is no need to amortize this cost using a thread pool, as is done in <tt>pbrt</tt>&rsquo;s
<a href="../Utilities/Parallelism.html#ThreadPool"><tt>ThreadPool</tt></a> class for CPU parallelism.

</p>
<p>Kernels may be launched both from the CPU and from the GPU, though <tt>pbrt</tt> only
does the former. In contrast to an ordinary function call, a kernel launch
cannot return any values to the caller. 
Kernels therefore must write their results to memory before exiting.

</p>
<p>An important hardware simplification that distinguishes CPUs and GPUs is
that GPUs bundle multiple threads into what we will refer to as a
<em>thread group</em>.<button style="button" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="right" data-html="true" class="btn footnote-button" title="This term corresponds to a <em>subgroup</em> in
OpenCL and Vulkan, a <em>warp</em> in CUDA&rsquo;s model, and a <em>wavefront</em> on
AMD GPUs.">
      <sup>&dagger;</sup>
    </button>
		 This group (32 threads on most current GPUs) executes
instructions together, which means that a single instruction decoder can be shared by
the group instead of requiring one for each executing thread.
Consequently, silicon die area that would ordinarily be needed for
instruction decoding can be dedicated to improving parallelism in the form of
additional ALUs.  Most GPU programming models further organize
thread groups into larger aggregations&mdash;though these are not used in <tt>pbrt</tt>&rsquo;s GPU
implementation, so we will not discuss them further here.

</p>
<p>While the hardware simplifications enabled by thread groups allow for
additional parallelism, the elimination of per-thread instruction
decoders also brings limitations that can have substantial performance
implications. Efficient GPU implementation of algorithms requires a thorough
understanding of them. Although the threads in a thread group are free to work
independently, just as the threads on different CPU cores are, the more that
they follow similar paths through the program, the better performance will be
achieved. This is a different performance model than for CPUs and can be a subtle
point to consider when optimizing code: performance is not just a consequence
of the computation performed by an individual thread, but also how often that
same computation is performed at the same time with other threads within
the same group.

</p>
<p>For example, consider this simple block of code:
</p>
<div class="fragmentcode">    if (condition) a();
    else b();</div><p>

Executed on a CPU, the processor will test the condition and then execute
either <tt>a()</tt> or <tt>b()</tt> depending on the condition&rsquo;s value.  On a
GPU, the situation is more complex: if all the threads in a thread
group follow the same control flow path, then execution proceeds as it does
on a CPU.  However, if some threads need to evaluate <tt>a()</tt> and some
<tt>b()</tt>, then the GPU will execute both functions&rsquo; instructions
with a subset of the threads disabled for each one.
These disabled threads represent a wasted opportunity to perform useful work.

</p>
<p>In the worst case, a computation could be serialized all the way down to the
level of individual threads, resulting in a <svg xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" width="4.133ex" height="2.176ex" style="vertical-align: -0.338ex;" viewBox="0 -791.3 1779.5 936.9" role="img" focusable="false" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-labelledby="MathJax-SVG-1-Title">

</svg> loss of performance that
would largely negate the benefits of the GPU. Algorithms like path
tracing are especially susceptible to this type of behavior, which is a
consequence of the physical characteristics of light: when a beam of light
interacts with an object, it will tend to spread out and eventually reach every
part of the environment with nonzero probability. Suppose that a bundle of rays
is processed by a thread group: due to this property, an initially coherent
computation could later encounter many different shapes and materials that are
implemented in different parts of the system. Additional work is necessary to
reorder computation into coherent groups to avoid such degenerate behavior.

</p>
<p>The implementation of the
<a href="../Textures_and_Materials/Texture_Interface_and_Basic_Textures.html#FloatMixTexture::Evaluate"><tt>FloatMixTexture::Evaluate()</tt></a> method from
Section&nbsp;<a href="../Textures_and_Materials/Texture_Interface_and_Basic_Textures.html#sec:mix-textures">10.3.3</a> can be better understood with thread groups in mind.  Its body was:
</p>
<div class="fragmentcode">    Float amt = amount.Evaluate(ctx);
    Float t1 = 0, t2 = 0;
    if (amt != 1) t1 = tex1.Evaluate(ctx);
    if (amt != 0) t2 = tex2.Evaluate(ctx);
    return (1 - amt) * t1 + amt * t2;</div><p>


</p>
<p>A more natural implementation might have been the following, which computes
the same result in the end:
</p>
<div class="fragmentcode">    Float amt = amount.Evaluate(ctx);
    if (amt == 0) return tex1.Evaluate(ctx);
    if (amt == 1) return tex2.Evaluate(ctx);
    return (1 - amt) * tex1.Evaluate(ctx) + amt * tex2.Evaluate(ctx);</div><p>


</p>
<p>Considered under the lens of GPU execution, we can see the benefit of the
first implementation.  If some of the threads have a value of&nbsp;0 for
<tt>amt</tt>, some have a value of&nbsp;1, and the rest have a value in between,
then the second implementation will execute the code for evaluating
<tt>tex1</tt> and <tt>tex2</tt> twice, for a different subset of threads for
each time.<button style="button" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="right" data-html="true" class="btn footnote-button" title="This assumes that the compiler is unable to
automatically restructure the code in the way that we have done manually.
It might, but it might not; our experience has been that it is best not to
expect too much of compilers in such ways, lest they disappoint.">
      <sup>&dagger;</sup>
    </button>
		
With the first implementation, all of the threads that need to
evaluate <tt>tex1</tt> do so together, and similarly for
<tt>tex2</tt>.

</p>
<p>We will say that execution across a thread group is <em>converged</em> when
all of the threads follow the same control flow path through the program,
and that it has become <em>divergent</em> at points in the program execution
where some threads follow one path and others follow another through the
program code.  Some divergence is inevitable, but the less there is the
better.  Convergence can be improved both by writing individual
blocks of code to minimize the number of separate control paths and
by sorting work so that all of the threads in a thread block do the
same thing.  This latter idea will come up repeatedly in
Section&nbsp;<a href="../Wavefront_Rendering_on_GPUs/Path_Tracer_Implementation.html#sec:pbrt-gpu-path-tracer">15.3</a> when we discuss the set of kernels
that the <a href="../Wavefront_Rendering_on_GPUs/Path_Tracer_Implementation.html#WavefrontPathIntegrator"><tt>WavefrontPathIntegrator</tt></a> executes.

</p>
<p>One implication of thread groups is that techniques like Russian roulette
may have a different performance impact on a CPU than on a GPU.  With
<tt>pbrt</tt>&rsquo;s CPU integrators, if a ray path is terminated with Russian roulette, the CPU thread can
immediately go on to start work on a new path.  Depending on how the
rendering computation is mapped to threads on a GPU, terminating one ray
path may not have the same benefit if it just leads to an idle thread being
carried along with an otherwise still-active thread group.

</p>
<p>Two differences are immediately apparent:
the peak memory bandwidth and 
number of TFLOPS (trillions of floating
point operations per second)
are both  approximately ten times higher on the GPU.
It is also clear that neither processor is able to reach its peak
performance solely by operating on values stored in memory.  For
example, the 3.8 TFLOPS that the CPU is capable of would require 15.2&nbsp;TB/s
of memory bandwidth if each 4-byte floating-point value operated on was to
be read from memory.  Consequently, we can see that the performance
of a computation such as iterating over a large array, reading each value,
squaring it, and writing the result back to memory would not be limited by
the processor&rsquo;s computational capabilities but would be limited by the
memory bandwidth.  We say that such computations are <em>bandwidth
limited</em>.

</p>
<p>A useful measurement of a computation is its <em>arithmetic intensity</em>,
which is usually measured as the number of floating-point operations
performed per byte of memory accessed.  Dividing peak TFLOPS by peak memory
bandwidth gives a measurement of how much arithmetic intensity a processor
requires to achieve its peak performance.  For this CPU, we can see that it
is roughly 38 floating-point operations (FLOPS) per byte, or 152 FLOPS for every 4-byte <tt>float</tt>
read from memory.  For the GPU, the values are 38.5 and 154,
respectively&mdash;remarkably, almost exactly the same.  Given such arithmetic
intensity requirements, it is easy to become bandwidth limited.

</p>
<p>Therefore, there must be some combination of reuse of each value read from
memory and reuse of intermediate computed values that are stored in
on-chip memory in order to reach peak floating-point performance.  Both the
processors&rsquo; register files and cache hierarchies are integral to keeping
them working productively by making some values available from faster
on-chip memory, though their effect is quite different on the two types of
architecture.  See Table&nbsp;<a href="#table:cpu-gpu-processor-specs">15.2</a>, which
presents additional quantities related to the individual processors on
the example CPU and GPU.

<p>To understand the differences, it is illuminating to compare the two in
terms of their cache size with respect to the number of threads that they
are running.  (Space in the caches is not explicitly allocated to
threads, though this is still a useful thought exercise.)  This CPU runs
one thread at a time on each core, with a second ready for hyperthreading,
giving 16&nbsp;KiB of L1 cache, 256&nbsp;KiB of L2, and 2&nbsp;MiB of L3 cache for each of
the two threads.  This is enough memory to give a fairly wide window for
the reuse of previous values and is enough that, for example, we do not
need to worry about how big the <a href="../Geometry_and_Transformations/Interactions.html#SurfaceInteraction"><tt>SurfaceInteraction</tt></a> structure is (it
is just under 256 bytes); it fits comfortably in the caches close to the processor.
These generous cache hierarchies can be a great help to programmers,
leaving them with the task of making sure their programs have some locality
in their memory accesses but often allowing them not to worry over it too
much further.

</p>
<p>The GPU runs thread groups of 32 threads, with as many as 31 additional
thread groups ready to switch to, for a total of 1,024 threads afoot.  We
are left with 128 bytes of L1 cache and 75 bytes of L2 per thread, meaning

</svg> less than the CPU, respectively.
If the GPU threads are accessing independent memory locations, we are left with
a very small window of potential data reuse that can be served by the caches.  Thus,
structuring GPU computation so that threads access the same locations in memory 
as much as possible can significantly improve performance by making
the caches more effective.

</p>
<p>GPUs partially make up for their small caches with large register files;
for the one in this comparison there are 65,536 32-bit registers for each GPU
processor, giving 64 or more for each thread.  (Note that this register
file actually has twice as much total storage as the processor&rsquo;s L1 cache.)
If a computation can be structured such that it fits into its allocation of
registers and has limited memory traffic (especially reads that are
different than other threads&rsquo;), then its computation can achieve high
performance on the GPU.

</p>
<p>The allocation of registers to a kernel must be determined at compile time;
this presents a balance for the compiler to strike.  On one hand,
allocating more registers to a kernel gives it more on-chip storage and, in
turn, generally reduces the amount of memory bandwidth that it requires.
However, the more registers that are allocated to a kernel, the fewer
threads can be scheduled on a processor.  For the example GPU, allocating
64 registers for each thread of a kernel means that 1,024 threads can run
on a processor at once.  128 registers per thread means just 512 threads,
and so forth.  The fewer threads that are running, the more difficult it is
to hide memory latency via thread switching, and performance may suffer when
all threads are stalled waiting for memory reads.

</p>
<p>The effect of these constraints is that reducing the size of objects can
significantly improve performance on the GPU: doing so reduces the amount
of bandwidth consumed when reading them from memory (and so may improve
performance if a computation is bandwidth limited) and can reduce the
number of registers consumed to store them after they have been loaded,
potentially allowing more threads and thus more effective latency hiding.
This theme will come up repeatedly later in the
chapter.

</p>
<p>The coherence of the memory locations accessed by the threads in a thread
group affects performance as well.  A reasonable model for thinking about
this is in terms of the processor&rsquo;s cache lines.  A common GPU
cache line size is 128 bytes.  The cost of a memory access by the threads
in a thread group is related to the total number of cache lines that
the threads access.  The best case is that they all access the same cache
line, for a location that is already in the cache.  (Thus with a
128-byte cache line size, 32 threads accessing
successive cache line&ndash;aligned 4-byte values
such as <tt>float</tt>s access a single cache line.)  Performance remains
reasonable if the locations accessed correspond to a small number of cache
lines that are already in the cache.

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>An entire cache line must be read for a cache miss.  Here as
well, the coherence of the locations accessed by the threads has a big
impact on performance: if all locations are in a single cache line, then a
single memory read can be performed.  If all 32 threads access locations that
lie in different cache lines, then 32 independent memory reads are required; not only
is there a significant bandwidth cost to reading so much data, but there is
much more memory latency&mdash;likely more than can be effectively hidden.
Thus, another important theme in the following
implementation will be organizing data structures and computation in order
to improve the coherence of memory locations accessed by the threads in a
thread group.

</p>
<p>A final issue related to memory performance arises due to the various
different types of memory that can be referenced by a computation.  The GPU
has its own <em>device memory</em>, distinct from the <em>host memory</em> used
by the CPU. Each GPU processor offers a small high-performance <em>shared
memory</em> that can be used by the threads running on it.<button style="button" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="right" data-html="true" class="btn footnote-button" title="Shared
memory corresponds to local memory in OpenCL, thread group shared memory in
DirectX Compute, and shared memory in CUDA.">
      <sup>&dagger;</sup>
    </button>
		
It is best interpreted as a manually managed cache.  Shared memory
and L1 and L2 caches provide much higher bandwidth and lower latency than
device memory, while host memory is the most expensive for the GPU to access: any read
or write must be encapsulated into a transaction that is sent over the
comparably slow PCI Express bus connecting the CPU and GPU. Optimally
placing and, if necessary, moving data in memory during multiple phases of
a computation requires expertise and extra engineering effort.

</p>
<p><tt>pbrt</tt> sidesteps this issue using <em>managed memory</em>, which exists in a
unified address space that can be accessed from both CPU and GPU. Its
physical location is undecided and can migrate on demand to improve
performance. This automatic migration comes at a small additional
performance cost, but this is well worth the convenience of not having to
micromanage memory allocations. In <tt>pbrt</tt>, the CPU initializes the scene in
managed memory, and this migration cost is paid once when rendering on the
GPU begins. There is then a small cost to read back the final image from the
<a href="../Cameras_and_Film/Film_and_Imaging.html#Film"><tt>Film</tt></a> at the end.  In the following implementation, as CPU code is
launching kernels on the GPU, it is important that it does not
inadvertently access GPU memory, which would harm performance.

</p>
<p>With these factors that affect GPU performance in mind, we can consider
various ways of structuring <tt>pbrt</tt>&rsquo;s rendering computation so that it is
suitable for the GPU.  First, consider applying the same parallelism
decomposition that is used in the <a href="../Introduction/pbrt_System_Overview.html#ImageTileIntegrator"><tt>ImageTileIntegrator</tt></a>: assigning each
tile of the image to a thread that is then responsible for evaluating its
pixel samples.  Such an approach is hopeless from the start.  Not only is
it unlikely to provide a sufficient number of threads to fill the GPU, but
the effect of the load imbalance among tiles is exacerbated when the
threads execute in groups.  (Recall
Figure&nbsp;<a href="../Introduction/pbrt_System_Overview.html#fig:task-time-distribution">1.17</a>, the histogram of time spent
rendering image tiles in Figure&nbsp;<a href="../Introduction/Photorealistic_Rendering_and_the_Ray-Tracing_Algorithm.html#fig:intro-raytracing-example">1.11</a>.)  Since a thread
group continues executing until all of its threads have finished,
performance is worse if the long-running threads are spread across many
different thread groups versus all together in fewer.

</p>
<p>Another natural approach might be to assign each pixel sample to a thread,
launching as many threads as there are pixel samples, and to have each
thread execute the same code as runs on the CPU to evaluate a pixel sample.
Each thread&rsquo;s task then would be to generate a camera ray, find the closest
intersection, evaluate the material and textures at the intersection point,
and so forth.  This is known as the <em>megakernel</em> approach, since a
single large kernel is responsible for all rendering computation for a ray.
This approach provides more than sufficient parallelism to the GPU, but suffers
greatly from execution divergence.  While the computation may remain
converged until intersections are found, if different rays hit objects with
different materials, or the same material but with different textures,
their execution will diverge and performance will quickly deteriorate.

</p>
<p>Even if the camera rays all hit objects with the same material, 
coherence will generally be lost with tracing the first batch of indirect
rays: some may find no intersection and leave the scene, others may hit
objects with various materials, and yet others may end up scattering in
participating media.  Each different case leads to execution divergence.
Even if all the threads end up sampling a light BVH, for instance, they
may not do so at the same time and thus that code may be executed multiple
times, just as was the case for the inferior approach of implementing the
<a href="../Textures_and_Materials/Texture_Interface_and_Basic_Textures.html#FloatMixTexture"><tt>FloatMixTexture</tt></a> <tt>Evaluate()</tt> method.  We can expect that over time all of
the threads will fully diverge, leading to processing that is less
efficient than it could be by a factor of the number of threads in a thread
group.

</p>
<p>The performance of a megakernel ray tracer can be improved with the
addition of work scheduling and reordering within the executing kernels.
Such a megakernel ray tracer can be seen as what is effectively a thread
group&ndash;wide state machine that successively chooses an operation to perform:
&ldquo;generate camera rays,&rdquo; &ldquo;find closest intersections,&rdquo; &ldquo;evaluate and
sample diffuse BSDFs,&rdquo; &ldquo;sample the light BVH,&rdquo; and so forth.  It might
choose among operations based on how many threads would like to perform the
corresponding operation.

</p>
<p>This approach can greatly improve execution convergence.  For example, if
only a single thread is waiting to evaluate and sample diffuse BSDFs, that
work can be deferred while other threads trace rays and do other rendering
work.  Perhaps some of those rays will intersect diffuse surfaces, adding
themselves to the tally of threads that need to do that operation.  When
that operation is eventually selected, it can be done for the benefit of
more threads, redundant executions saved.

</p>
<p>Direct implementation of the megakernel approach does have disadvantages.  The megakernels
themselves may be comprised of a large amount of code (effectively, everything that the
renderer needs to do), which can lead to long compilation times depending
on the sophistication of the ray tracer.  They are further limited to
finding shared work among the threads in a thread group or, at most, the
threads running on a single GPU processor. It therefore may not be
possible to achieve an optimal degree of thread convergence.  Nevertheless,
the approach is a good one, and is the most common one for real-time ray
tracers today.

</p>
<p>The other main GPU ray tracer architecture is termed <em>wavefront</em>.  A
wavefront ray tracer separates the main operations into separate kernels,
each one operating on many pixel samples in parallel: for example, there
might be one kernel that generates camera rays, another that finds ray
intersections, perhaps one to evaluate diffuse materials and another to
evaluate dielectrics, and so forth.  The kernels are organized in a
dataflow architecture, where each one may enqueue additional work to be
performed in one or more subsequent kernels.

</p>
<p>A significant advantage of the wavefront approach is that execution in each
kernel can start out fully converged: the diffuse-material kernel is
invoked for only the intersection points with a diffuse material, and so
forth.  While the execution may diverge within the kernel, regularly
starting out with converged execution can greatly aid performance,
especially for systems with a wide variety of materials, BSDFs, lights,
and so forth.

</p>
<p>Another advantage of the wavefront approach is that different numbers of
registers can be allocated to different kernels.  Thus, simple kernels can
use fewer registers and reap benefits in more effective latency hiding, and
it is only the more complex kernels that incur the costs of that trade-off.  In contrast,
the register allocation for a megakernel must be made according to the
worst case across the entire set of rendering computation.

</p>
<p>However, wavefront ray tracers pay a cost in bandwidth.  Because data does
not persist on-chip between kernel launches, each kernel must read all of
its inputs from memory and then write its results back to it.  In
contrast, megakernels can often keep intermediate information on-chip.  The
performance of a wavefront ray tracer is more likely than a megakernel to be limited by the
amount of memory bandwidth and not the GPU&rsquo;s computational
capabilities.  This is an undesirable state of affairs since it
is projected that bandwidth will continue to grow more slowly than
computation in future processor architectures.

</p>
<p>The recent addition of hardware ray-tracing capabilities to GPUs has led to
the development of graphics programming interfaces that allow the user to specify which
kernels to run at various stages of ray tracing.  This gives an alternative
to the megakernel and wavefront approaches that avoids many of their
respective disadvantages.  With these APIs, the user not only provides
single kernels for operations like generating initial rays, but can also
specify multiple kernels to run at ray intersection points&mdash;where the kernel
that runs at a given point might be determined based on an object&rsquo;s
material, for example.  Scheduling computation and orchestrating the flow
of data between stages is not the user&rsquo;s concern, and the GPU&rsquo;s hardware and
software has the opportunity to schedule work in a way that is tuned to the
hardware architecture.  (The semantics of these APIs are discussed further
in Section&nbsp;<a href="../Wavefront_Rendering_on_GPUs/Path_Tracer_Implementation.html#sec:gpu-intersection-testing">15.3.6</a>.)

</p>
<p>This version of <tt>pbrt</tt> adopts the wavefront approach for its GPU rendering
path, although some of its kernels fuse together multiple stages of
the ray-tracing computation in order to reduce the amount of memory
traffic that is used.  We found this approach to be a good fit given the
variety of materials, <a href="../Reflection_Models/BSDF_Representation.html#BxDF"><tt>BxDF</tt></a>s, and light sources that <tt>pbrt</tt> supports.
Further, rendering features like volume
scattering fit in nicely: we can skip the corresponding kernels entirely if
the scene does not include those effects.

</p>
<p>
As with the CPU-targeted <tt>Integrator</tt>s, a
<a href="../Processing_the_Scene_Description/BasicScene_and_Final_Object_Creation.html#BasicScene"><tt>BasicScene</tt></a> parses the scene description and stores
various entities that represent scene components.  When the wavefront
integrator is being used, the parsed scene is then
passed to the <tt>RenderWavefront()</tt><span class="anchor" id="RenderWavefront"></span>
function, which is defined in the file
<a href="https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v4/tree/master/src/pbrt/wavefront/wavefront.cpp"><tt>wavefront/wavefront.cpp</tt></a>.  Beyond some housekeeping, its main
task is to allocate an instance of the <a href="../Wavefront_Rendering_on_GPUs/Path_Tracer_Implementation.html#WavefrontPathIntegrator"><tt>WavefrontPathIntegrator</tt></a> class
and to call its
<tt>Render()</tt> method.
Since the housekeeping is not very interesting, we will not include its
implementation here. 

</p>
<p>The <tt>WavefrontPathIntegrator</tt> constructor converts many of the
entities in the <a href="../Processing_the_Scene_Description/BasicScene_and_Final_Object_Creation.html#BasicScene"><tt>BasicScene</tt></a> to <tt>pbrt</tt> objects in the same way as is
done for the CPU renderer: all the lights are converted to corresponding
instances of the <tt>Light</tt> classes, and similarly for the camera, film,
sampler, light sampler, media, materials, and textures.
One important
difference, however, is that the <a href="../Introduction/Using_and_Understanding_the_Code.html#Allocator"><tt>Allocator</tt></a> that is provided for them
allocates managed memory so that it can be initialized on the CPU and
accessed by the GPU.  Another difference is that only some shapes are
handled with <tt>pbrt</tt>&rsquo;s <a href="../Shapes/Basic_Shape_Interface.html#Shape"><tt>Shape</tt></a> implementations.  Shapes like triangles that
have native support from the GPU&rsquo;s ray intersection hardware are instead
handled using that hardware.  Finally,
image map textures use a specialized implementation that uses the GPU&rsquo;s
texturing hardware for texture lookups.

<p>Once the scene representation is ready, a call to
<a href="../Wavefront_Rendering_on_GPUs/Path_Tracer_Implementation.html#WavefrontPathIntegrator::Render"><tt>WavefrontPathIntegrator::Render()</tt></a> starts the rendering process.  The
details of the implementation of that method will be the subject of the
following sections of this chapter, but Figure&nbsp;<a href="#fig:gpu-kernels-overview">15.2</a> gives an overview of the
kernels that it launches.<button style="button" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="right" data-html="true" class="btn footnote-button" title="In describing the
<tt>WavefrontPathIntegrator</tt> in the remainder of this chapter, we will
frequently use the terminology of &ldquo;launching kernels&rdquo; to describe its
operation, even though when it is running on the CPU, &ldquo;launch&rdquo; is just a
function call, and a kernel is a regular class method.">
      <sup>&dagger;</sup>
    </button>
		  The sequence of
computations is similar to that of the <a href="../Light_Transport_II_Volume_Rendering/Volume_Scattering_Integrators.html#VolPathIntegrator::Li"><tt>VolPathIntegrator::Li()</tt></a>
method, though decomposed into kernels. Queues are used to buffer work between
kernels: each kernel can push work onto one or more queues to
be processed in subsequent kernels.

</p>
<p>Rendering starts with a kernel that generates camera rays for a number of
pixel samples (typically, a million or so).  Given camera rays, the loop up
to the maximum ray depth can begin.  Each time through the loop, the
following kernels are executed:
</p>
<ul>
<li> First, samples for use with the ray are generated using the
<a href="../Sampling_and_Reconstruction/Sampling_Interface.html#Sampler"><tt>Sampler</tt></a> and stored in memory for use in later kernels.

<li> The closest intersection of each ray is found with the scene
geometry.  The kernel that finds these intersections
pushes work onto a variety of queues to
be processed by other kernels, including a queue for rays that escape the
scene, one for rays that hit emissive geometry, and another for rays that
pass through participating media.  Rays that intersect surfaces are pushed
onto queues that partition work based on material types.

<li> Rays passing through participating media are then processed, possibly
leading to a shadow ray and an indirect ray being enqueued if the ray
scatters.  Unscattered rays that were earlier found to have intersected a
surface are pushed on to the same variety of queues as are used in the
intersection kernel for rays not passing through media.

<li> Rays that have intersected emissive geometry and rays that have left
the scene are handled by two kernels that both update rays&rsquo; radiance
estimates to incorporate the effect of emission found by such rays.

<li> Each material is then handled individually, with separate kernels
specialized based on the material type.  Textures are evaluated to
initialize a <a href="../Reflection_Models/BSDF_Representation.html#BSDF"><tt>BSDF</tt></a> and a light is sampled.  This, too, leads to
indirect and shadow rays being

enqueued.



<li> A final kernel traces shadow rays and incorporates their
contributions into the rays&rsquo; radiance estimates, including accounting for
absorption along rays in participating media.
</ul><p>


</p>
<p>Until the maximum ray depth, the loop then starts again with the queued
indirect rays replacing the camera rays as the rays to trace next.
